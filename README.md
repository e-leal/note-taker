# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
Note Taker is a note saving application. After clicking on the 'Get Started' button, the user is directed to the notes page where they are able to enter and save new notes. The user is also able to view previously saved notes on the left hand side and also delete, or remove, any unwanted/unnedded notes. Each of the notes saved, contains a unique id ( that the user does not interface with), a title, and text content.

## Installation
Once repository is cloned, you will need to run 'npm init -y', 'npm i express', 'npm i shortid', 'npm i fs', and 'npm install' to install all the necessary packages for the application to run.

## Usage
In order to use the application, you will need to make sure that your package.json file "scripts" section contains 'start' and specifies the action to be 'node server.js'. Then you will need to run 'npm start' or 'node server.js'. Once the console shows that the server is now listening port 3001, you can navigate to "http://localhost:3001" to reach the home page.
